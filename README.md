# Single-Perceptron-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-with-Visualization-on-A-Plane
Comparison between single Perceptron classifier and navie Bayes classifier over labeled scatterplots on 2 dimensional plane and its visualization with matplotlib


## Bacic Idea
From an inspiration by [Perceptron demo](https://youtu.be/wl7gVvI-HuY?t=1331) on lecture 4 and [Naive Bayes demo](https://youtu.be/rqB0XWoMreU?t=2498) on lecture 10 of Kilian Weinberger's [Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems course](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/) at Cornell University, I have built a conceptually similar interactive single Perceptron and naive Bayes demo in Python with matplotlib event handling.

### How to use (setting)

#### git clone
git clone to have this repository on your local machine as follows.
```ruby
git clone git@github.com:YANJINI/Single-Perceptron-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-with-Visualization-on-A-Plane.git
```

#### Path control
To import modules written in this repository on your local macine, you need control path to this clone, which could be done as below.
```ruby
import sys
sys.path.extend(['/your_local_directory_to_this_clone/Single-Perceptron-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-with-Visualization-on-A-Plane'])
```
