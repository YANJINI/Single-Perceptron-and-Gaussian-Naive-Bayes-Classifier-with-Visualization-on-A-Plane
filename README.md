# Single-Perceptron-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-with-Visualization-on-A-Plane
Comparison between single Perceptron classifier and navie Bayes classifier over labeled scatterplots on 2 dimensional plane and its visualization

## Bacic Idea
From an inspiration by [Perceptron demo](https://youtu.be/wl7gVvI-HuY?t=1331) on lecture 4 Kilian Weinberger's Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems course at Cornell University, I have built a conceptually similar Perceptron demo with matplotlib event handling.
